/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Given tables represent the marks scored by engineering students.
Create a report to display the following results for each student.
  - Student_id, Student name
  - Total Percentage of all marks
  - Failed subjects (must be comma seperated values in case of multiple failed subjects)
  - Result (if percentage >= 70% then 'First Class', if >= 50% & <=70% then 'Second class', if <=50% then 'Third class' else 'Fail'.
  			The result should be Fail if a students fails in any subject irrespective of the percentage marks)
	
	*** The sequence of subjects in student_marks table match with the sequential id from subjects table.
	*** Students have the option to choose either 4 or 5 subjects only.
